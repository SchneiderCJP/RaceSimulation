<h1> Race Simulation üèéÔ∏è</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
A program that simulates a race with 6 cars total, where each car is one of three different vehicles where each is looking for a specific 2/3 resources. The cars race for a set number of laps, however each car must wait in a queue when they are in need of a certain resource. A car can't return to the race until the car has gained the resource they need. The amount of laps a resource lasts a car before it needs to replenish is randomly generated. This simulation is coded to provide a different outcome each time it is run to represent an actual race. For more of an in-depth description, please see the design document.
